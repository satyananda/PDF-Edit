/** PDFString is an alias for NSData. It represents regular and hexadecimal string PDF objects. A string object consists of a series of bytes â€” unsigned integer values in the range 0 to 255. Strings are interpreted according to the 7-bit ASCII encoding in the case of literal strings, however, any 8-bit value may appear in a string. Characters outside the 7-bit ASCII character set may be represented using ASCII characters via the \ddd escape sequence. eg \245
